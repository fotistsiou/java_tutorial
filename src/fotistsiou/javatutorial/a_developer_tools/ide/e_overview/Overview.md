# Overview

The main goal of IntelliJ IDEA is to enhance your productivity while coding. Here are some basic tips to help speed up and improve the comfort of your development experience. While these are general tips, you can find more resources on the [IntelliJ IDEA webpage](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea.html).

## Use Keyboard Shortcuts
Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up coding and even help reduce the risk of Repetitive Strain Injury. IntelliJ IDEA is designed to be keyboard-centric, allowing you to:

- Choose from pre-configured shortcut schemes (keymaps) in **File | Settings | Keymap**.
- View the list of actions and their corresponding shortcuts via the search feature.
- Search for actions by pressing their shortcuts.
- Set up a custom keymap if you need a personalized list of shortcuts.

> **Note**: For a printable cheat sheet based on your OS's default keymap, go to **Help | Keyboard Shortcuts PDF**.

## Go to the Dark Side
By default, IntelliJ IDEA uses a light color scheme, but you can switch to the dark **Darcula** theme in **File | Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance** by selecting **Darcula** under the Theme dropdown.

> **Note**: you can use ⌃ \` (on macOS) or Ctrl + \` (on Windows and Linux) to switch quickly between color schemes and keymaps.

## Local Terminal
IntelliJ IDEA includes a local terminal that lets you access the command line directly in the IDE. You can work with the command prompt, PowerShell, Bash, etc., depending on your platform.

- To open the terminal, press **⌥ F12** (macOS) / **Alt + F12** (Windows/Linux) or click the **Terminal** tool window button.

## Conclusion
With IntelliJ IDEA, you can:

- Select and customize keyboard shortcuts in **File | Settings | Keymap**.
- Change the theme in **File | Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance**.
- Open the terminal with **⌥ F12** (macOS) / **Alt + F12** (Windows/Linux) or the Terminal button.

Now you have a solid foundation to start using IntelliJ's common features effectively. Put these tips into practice!
