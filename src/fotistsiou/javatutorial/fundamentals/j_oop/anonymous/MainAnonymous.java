/**
 * Anonymous Class
 * -> It is an inner classes with no name.
 * -> Since it has no name, we cannot directly create new instances of them later.
 * -> We have to declare and instantiate anonymous classes in a single expression at the point of use.
 * -> In order to create an anonymous class we have to:
 * -> 1. Extend an existing class.
 * ->    - When we instantiate an anonymous class from an existent one, we use the syntax "new Class(...){...}".
 * ->    - In the parentheses, we specify the parameters that are required by the constructor of the class
 *         that we are extending.
 * ->    - Anonymous classes cannot have any static members except for those that are constant.
 * -> 2. Implement an interface.
 * ->    - When we instantiate an anonymous class from an interface, we use the syntax "new Interface(){...}".
 * ->    - Javaâ€™s interfaces have no constructors, so the parentheses always remain empty.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Anonymous Object
 * -> It is an instance of a class that is created without assigning it to a named reference variable.
 * -> This object can be an instance of either a named class or an anonymous class.
