- The class name should match the Java file name.
- To execute code in Java, a class must contain a main() method.
- The main() method is the entry point for every Java application.
- Curly braces {...} mark the beginning and end of a block of code.
- Each code statement must end with a semicolon.

```java
public class SyntaxConventionsComments {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
